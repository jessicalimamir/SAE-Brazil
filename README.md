Analysis of consumption/expense of electrical materials | Brazil level ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·

POF, or family budget survey in English, is a survey conducted by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) which aims to understand and evaluate the consuption patterns and expenditure spheres of the Brazilian population. The survey gathers detailed data on spending across various categories such as food, housing, healthcare, transportation, and education, among others. Additionally, the POF examines income distribution, family structure, and other relevant socioeconomic variables. From this assessment, it is possible to infer the living conditions and characteristics of individuals in each household and the family as a whole.

#### POF target population: private households and their residents in the area covered by the research in urban and rural situations. Areas excluded: barracks, military bases, accommodation, camps, boats, penitentiaries, penal colonies, prisons, jails, asylums, orphanages, convents and hospitals.
#### Collection Method: POF information is obtained directly from private households selected by sampling, includes in-person interviews and data collection from a representative sample of households nationwide. This approach enables an extensive and detailed analysis of consumption trends and the living conditions of Brazilian families.

Collection instruments are operated electronically through questionnaires. For this research, we will use 3 of them:
Collective expenses data: household expenses for all its residents
Individual expenses data: individual expenses of residents
Residents data: sociodemographic data of household members

This research focuses on analyzing the consumption of electrical materials, with the aim of estimating locations of business creation or growth opportunities, at a micro level. The POF is made up of seven different questionnaires. For the purpose of the study, three databases were used: collective expenses, individual expenses and residents. As a way of complementing sociodemographic data and geographic coordinates, other Brazilian census bases are also used.
